## About

Create a command-line tool using directory structure to define nested subcommands.

- **Intuitive:** Creating new commands is fast and straightforward
- **Helpful:** Automatically creates help text that is displayed when a user passes the `--help` flag
- **Meticulous:** Separates args and flags making them easy to use, and validates the values that are provided

## Install

```sh
npm install directory-command
```

## Node version support

This module requires node version >=8.

## Setup

`directory-command` is designed to make setup as quick as possible.

### Use the `directory-command` cli tool

With `npx`:

```console
npx directory-command new --name example-cli
```

Installing globally:

```console
npm i -g directory-command
directory-command new --name example-cli
```

Make sure to add `directory-command` to your project dependencies.

### Manual setup

#### Create a bin directory

```console
mkdir bin
```

#### Create bin/index.js

```console
touch bin/index.js
```

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const path = require('path')
const directoryCommand = require('directory-command')

const directory = path.join(__dirname, 'commands')

directoryCommand(directory, process.argv.slice(2), {
  commandName: 'example'
})
```

#### Create a bin/commands directory

```console
mkdir bin/commands
```

#### Create a command

```console
touch bin/commands/index.js
```

A command file looks like:

```js
function command (args, flags, context) {
  console.log(args, flags, context)
}

const args = []
const flags = []

const options = {
  description: 'example command'
}

module.exports = { command, args, flags }
```

### Args

Args are options that are identified by their position. The order of args matters. The order that you define them in the `args` array of a command is the order they need to be placed when using the cli tool.

Here's an example definition of an arg:

```js
{
  name: 'hello',
  type: 'string',
  description: 'An arg example for saying hello'
}
```

Here's how it looks when you use the arg:

```console
example-cli hi
```

Here's how you use the `hello` arg in your command:

```js
function command (args, flags, context) {
  console.log(args.hello) // logs `hi`
}

const args = [
  {
    name: 'hello',
    type: 'string',
    description: 'An arg example for saying hello'
  }
]
const flags = []
module.exports = { command, args, flags}
```

#### Accessing all args as an array

To get all arg values as an array in their original order, use `args._`. This array will not include flags, only the values of args as they've been entered on the command line.

### Flags

Unlike args, the order that they are defined in does not matter, and they can be placed in any order when using a cli tool.

An example flag definition:

```js
{
  name: 'type-of-day',
  alias: ['d', 'day'],
  type: 'string',
  description: 'An arg example for saying what kind of day it is'
}
```


Here's how it looks when you use the flag:

```console
example-cli --type-of-day awesome
```

We set an alias for the flag, so we can use that instead:

```console
example-cli -d awesome
```

Note that the `alias` property can be a string with one alias, or an array with multiple strings as shown here. This applies to both args and flags.

Here's how you use the `type-of-day` flag in your command:

```js
function command (args, flags, context) {
  console.log(flags['type-of-day']) // logs `awesome`
}

const args = []
const flags = [
  {
    name: 'type-of-day',
    alias: ['d', 'day'],
    type: 'string',
    description: 'An arg example for saying what kind of day it is'
  }
]
module.exports = { command, args, flags}
```

### Creating subcommands

Subcommands can be nested as deeply as needed.

A file placed either at:

```console
bin/commands/new/index.js
```

or:

```console
bin/commands/new.js
```

can be called with:

```console
example-cli new
```

A file placed at:

```console
bin/commands/new/example.js
```

can be called with:

```console
example-cli new example
```

### Default/root command

The default command is the index.js file of the specified commands directory. See the [basic usage example](examples/basic-usage).
